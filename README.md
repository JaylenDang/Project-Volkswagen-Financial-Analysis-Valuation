# Project Volkswagen Financial Analysis & Valuation

## Overview
This project is a financial analysis and valuation study of Volkswagen AG, created as part of the Corporate Financial Policy FINA2222 unit at the University of Western Australia. The analysis project explores the impact of leveraged recapitalization on Volkswagen’s share price, Weighted Average Cost of Capital (WACC), and Earnings Per Share (EPS), as well as other key financial metrics. Through this project, we evaluate Volkswagen's capital structure decisions and analyze how these strategies affect the company's financial stability and health.

## Project Objectives
The project aims to:
1. Assess the potential effects of a leveraged recapitalization on Volkswagen's share price.
2. Calculate the impact of additional debt on the company's Weighted Average Cost of Capital (WACC).
3. Conduct a sensitivity analysis on EPS under various EBIT scenarios.
4. Identify other significant effects of the debt issuance on Volkswagen’s position in the automotive industry.

## Methodology
The project involved the following steps:
1. **Valuation Analysis**: Evaluating the effect of using $7 billion in debt for either share repurchase or a special dividend and its impact on firm value.
2. **Cost of Capital (WACC)**: Calculating how the additional debt affects the overall cost of capital for both repurchase and dividend scenarios.
3. **EPS Sensitivity Analysis**: Performing sensitivity analysis on EPS by examining the effects of different EBIT scenarios (worst, likely, and best cases).
4. **Market and Competitive Analysis**: Discussing additional effects of leveraged recapitalization specific to Volkswagen’s market position, leveraging theories from Corporate Finance.

## Key Results
- **Leverage Impact on Valuation**: Detailed comparison of share repurchase vs. special dividend scenarios.
- **WACC Adjustments**: Analysis of debt impacts on capital cost structure.
- **EPS Variability**: Sensitivity analysis visualizing EPS fluctuations across different economic conditions.
- **Additional Findings**: Strategic insights into how leverage may influence Volkswagen's competitive position in a challenging automotive market.
